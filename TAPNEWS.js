document.getElementById("Uploadpage").addEventListener("click", function()//this statement helps me get the id of the button and we add an event listener where by anytime someone clicks the js function is triggered
{
window.location.href = "TAPNEWSUPLOAD.html"; //under our case the function triggered is the button links to a page for uploading video files 
});
